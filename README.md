# HealthHive
HealthHive is a healthcare and social-impact platform designed to improve access to mental health support, disease awareness, and NGO discovery. The application combines a modern React frontend with Python-based machine learning services to deliver intelligent, user-focused healthcare solutions.

## Key Features
1) NGO Search and Listing
Discover and explore NGOs focused on healthcare and mental well-being, enabling users to find support organizations easily.

2) Mental Health Chatbot
An AI-powered chatbot that provides mental health support, basic guidance, and empathetic conversational assistance.

3) AI Disease Prediction Model
A machine learning model that predicts potential diseases based on user-provided symptoms and health parameters.

## Project Status & Demo

This project was initially built during a hackathon to showcase a full-stack healthcare solution combining React frontend with Python-based AI services.
Due to server and model hosting costs required to keep the ML backend live, the production deployment was taken down after the event. The core functionality—including NGO listing, mental health chatbot, and AI disease prediction—was fully developed and works as demonstrated.
